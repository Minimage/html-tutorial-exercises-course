			<i><strong>Inspirational quotes</strong></i>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as <br />
				a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. <br />
				Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.
			</p>
			<p>- Helen Keller</p>
